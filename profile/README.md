# Nobody Came

Welcome to Nobody Came - an open-source organization trying to make language models (probably failing tho, this description is before we've made anything lol).

## About Us
At Nobody Came, we believe in the power of language and aim to provide a free and innovative alternative to traditional large language models.

Our mission is to empower developers to unleash their creativity and reshape the future of communication.

Nah, we just don't like OpenAI's closed-ness.
